I think this lab went relatively smoothly for the most part. I had two main issues.
The first one being I forgot to put the resources in the folder and was wondering
why it wasn't doing anything. The second one being I was wondering why .size()
wasn't doing anything before I realized they took it out in JQuery 3.0.

My 4b changes the text color of all the added list items, when the "last" one
that was written into html file is clicked. To fix it I would find a way to 
separate the last added list items from the last one written in.

I have edited 4b to make it so that the items are added dynamically and still
work even after adding items.
