I figured out how to use live preview this lab, in addition to 
learning how to format things.
I think a lot of my struggle was remembering to indent things with 3
spaces instead of tabs, because I kept needing to go back and re-indent because I used tabs instead of spaces.
Also, I don't think I pulled my repo to my server properly.
