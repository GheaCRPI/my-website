It took me a long time to understand what I was supposed to do in this lab. However once I 
understood the point of the lab I think it went relatively smoothly for me. I did run into an
issue where my Atom feed wasn't validating because I forgot to put a / after the end of the 
link which caused the tag to not close and the feed to not validate. I spent 3 hours trying
to find out what was wrong with it (not an exaggeration).
