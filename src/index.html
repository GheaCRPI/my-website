            I am currently a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. I am obtaining a dual major in 
            Computer Science along with Information Technology and Web Sciences (ITWS).
            Currently I do not know what my focus is going to be on, however I am interested in 
            Cybersecurity and Web Development.
