            MindBodyU was a semester long project that was developed with a team of 3. It is 
            a webpage focused on improving the mental and physical health of college students.

            Room-Ease was a centralized housing portal that I prototyped with a group of 5. In 
            this project I mainly worked on the frontend of the roommates page, and helped fix the 
            frontend of the home page, login, and signup page.
