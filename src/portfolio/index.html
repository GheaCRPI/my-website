            MindBodyU was a semester long project that was developed with a team of 3. It is 
            a webpage focused on improving the mental and physical health of college students.

            Room-Ease was a centralized housing portal that I prototyped with a group of 5. This project 
            aimed to better improve the finding a roommate experience, as well as provide a place to 
            post subleases and other housing availibilites that are student friendly. In 
            this project I mainly worked on the frontend of the roommates page, and helped fix the 
            frontend of the home page, login, and signup page.

            This website is currently a work in progress, but I plan on using it to contain my 
            portfolio, as well as use it to practice styling different things and using different 
            techniques to make things more aesthetically pleasing.
